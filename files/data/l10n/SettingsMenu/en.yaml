ClampLighting: "Clamp Lighting"
ClampLightingDesc: "Restrict the amount of lighting that an object can receive to a maximum of (1,1,1).\n\nEnabling this option results in fixed-function compatible lighting, but the lighting may appear dull and there might be color shifts. \n\nDisabling this option results in more realistic lighting."
